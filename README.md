# JS_Projects
Collection of small Vanilla JavaScript projects that I built

Quote Generator vanilla JavaScript Project: It is live on: https://quote-generator-js-project01.netlify.app/

It fetches data from https://jacintodesign.github.io/quotes-api/data/quotes.json API and shows random quotes. User can share it on their Twitter.
